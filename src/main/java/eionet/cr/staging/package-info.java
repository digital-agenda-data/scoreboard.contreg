 * This package contains helper classes, services, sub-packages, etc related to the functionality of the so-called
 * "staging databases" that originates from the European Commission's "Digital Agenda Scoreboard" project
 * (https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/scoreboard) but as of Jan 2013 looks perfectly useful for other projects as well.
