<p>Realising that there is no-one appointed to track down every dataset that could be of interest, we made it a user-driven solution. Anyone with an Eionet account is able to suggest datasets to the Content Registry. If it isn’t in RDF format, it won’t be loaded in to the database, but other users will be able to see it when they search the Content Registry. The mechanism is similar to social bookmarking services such as http://delicious.com/. The user can also add metadata for the link: Title, description, tags etc.</p>
<p>You start by entering the URL of the resource you want to register. The system will immediately attempt a harvest in the background. While harvesting is happening you will see:</p>

<div class="advice-msg">The resource is currently being harvested!</div>

<p>The system will reharvest the source every 6 weeks to keep the local copy in sync.</p>

<p>You can then add your own metadata. If you have just registered a URL you go here directly. But at any time you are looking at a factsheet for an object in CR you can add information. You do it by selecting "edit" in the operations dropdown list. The illustration below shows how it works.</p>
